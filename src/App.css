/* ===== CART ICON STYLING ===== */
/* This section styles the shopping cart icon that appears throughout the app */

/* Main cart icon styling - makes it look interactive and professional */
.cart-icon {
  display: inline-block;        /* Shows the icon as a block element (like a button) */
  font-weight: bold;           /* Makes the icon text bold for better visibility */
  cursor: pointer;             /* Shows a hand cursor when hovering over the icon */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;  /* Adds smooth animation when the icon changes size */
}

/* ===== CART ICON ANIMATION ===== */
/* This section handles the "pop" animation when items are added to cart */

/* Animation class that gets added to cart icon when items are added */
.cart-icon.animate {
  animation: pop 0.4s ease;    /* Runs the "pop" animation for 0.4 seconds with smooth easing */

/* ===== POP ANIMATION KEYFRAMES ===== */
/* Defines the actual animation sequence - how the icon grows and shrinks */

/* The "pop" animation makes the cart icon grow and shrink to give visual feedback */

  }
  
  /* 30% through animation - icon grows */

  }
  
  /* 60% through animation - icon shrinks slightly */
  60% {
    transform: scale(0.95);    /* Icon shrinks to 95% of normal size (creates bounce effect) */
  }
  
  /* End of animation - back to normal */
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);       /* Icon returns to normal size (100%) */
